Learning Git and GitHub reflections.

This repository contains the reflections I have made during the course "[Learning Git and GitHub reflections](https://br.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775/)".
They are good for beginners who wants to see what features Git and GitHub have, and what they are used for.
