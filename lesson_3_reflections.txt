When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

    A remote repository is useful if you want to share your repository to
    others. In this way, you can have multiple colaborators. Also, your
    repository will not be just a local repository. This means you will
    have access of your remote repository from any other computer than
    yours.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you choose stay up-to-date automatically, it may import versions
    that are still not complete to be used. But rather, if you choose to
    pull changes manually, you can have the control of when is the best
    time to do it.
