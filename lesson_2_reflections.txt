What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When you initialize a repository by "git init" command, you create a
    ".git" directory. Then, with "git status" command, you can see if
    the git was indeed initialized.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is a intermediate region between the working
    directory and the repository. When you have files on the working
    repository, not necessarelly they tracked. When you add one or
    more files to the staging area by "git add" command, you turn them
    in tracked files, but still not commited. The committed files are
    in the repository.

change?
